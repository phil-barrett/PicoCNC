## Usage Notes

### KiCAD Files
These were created with KiCAD V8.0

They are released with the intent of using JLCPCB to manufacture the PCB and 
assemble them into a working circuit board. The directory production includes full gerbers (PicoU4XBB.zip), 
Bill of Materials including JLCPCB library part numbers (bom,.csv) and Centroid PnP (positions.csv).

### JLCPCB Library part numbers
These were current as of June 2025.  You may need to change due to out of stock parts.
